# Password Generator

## Purpose   
\
The password generator is an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria.   

## How it Works

When the "Generate Password" button is clicked, the user is prompted for a series of criteria:
* Length of the password (must be between 8 and 128 characters)
    * The user's input is validated and user is prompted again if their password length does not fall between 8 and 128   
* Use of lower-case letters in the password   
* Use of upper-case letters in the password   
* Use of numbers in the password   
* Use of special characters in the password   
* User criteria is validated to check that at least one character type was selected and user is prompted to select at least one character type if the answer is false   

When all criteria have been validated, a random password is generated

## Process

* I began this project by pseudo-coding the steps I would need to take in order to make the application work as intended
* The HTML and CSS were provided for me, so my focus was solely on using JavaScript to create the functionality of the page
* I incorporated what I had learned about loops, functions, properties and methods into the validation of criteria and generation of randomly-selected characters
* I did use the internet to fill in some gaps where I ran into problems with my code
